The world doesn't need another CMS, the world needs this CMS.

_Stupid joke aside._

**This is a work in progress**

Our goal is to create a really easy to use and high extensible CMS. Where the developer is able to do what he wants without making a huge compromise, and the client is happy managing his site.

These are some of our targets:

 * Completely unit testet CMS.
 * A Beautiful Backend.
 * High scalability.
 
If you are also not that happy with all the cms systems out there, Join us! Help us creating a beautiful new way to manage content.
